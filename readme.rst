UOS Offline Player
==================

You will need the video files for this, we're not checking them in.

Steps to make this work:

#. On a blank flash drive, create a folder structure of ``/uos-kiosk/resources/app`` and copy this repo into that folder.
#. Run an ``npm install`` in that folder to get the dependencies.
#. Download the newest release of Electron and place its files in the ``uos-kiosk`` directory.
#. Copy the following files from the repo into the root folder: ``Instructions.txt``, ``Under Our Skin.bat``, ``Under Our Skin - fullscreen.bat``, and ``Open video folder.bat``

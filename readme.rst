UOS Offline Player
==================

You will need the video files for this, we're not checking them in.

Steps to make this work:

1. On a blank flash drive, create a folder structure of ``/uos-kiosk/resources/app`` and copy this repo into that folder.
2. Run an ``npm install`` in that folder to get the dependencies.
2. Download the newest release of Electron and place its files in the ``uos-kiosk`` directory.
3. Copy the following files from the repo into the root folder:
  * ``Instructions.txt``
  * ``Under Our Skin.bat``
  * ``Under Our Skin - fullscreen.bat``
  * ``Open video folder.bat``

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
POLITICALLY CORRECT

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.920
Marci Owens: Saying something that could offend
people without offending people.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.940
Duck Bae: Using one word as opposed to another.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.220
Jerrell Davis: Politically correct. That's
that's, that's some shit white people made up,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.760
to be straight up like, I didn't even
hear that term until I got to college.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.019
Darrell Hillaire: It's something that those
people in the non-Indian world use quite often.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.259
You know, we gotta be politically correct,
we get a call them Native Americans, not Indians.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.720
Greg RIckel: I think it always was to a degree.
How do you say things nicely.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.500
And in ways that will not hurt people.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.020
Tariqa Waters: I hate political correctness.
Oh it gets on my nerves, and I don't think it's needed.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.900
It ruined our ability to communicate
with one another, where you could call somebody out

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.220
for being whatever they were being to
you. If somebody said something that was offensive,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.670
you knew it immediately, they were being offensive.
Now, to me, it's more offensive if you are

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.640
really trying to figure out how not to offend
me. I don't think you're really expressing

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.860
how you truly feel when you're being so politically
correct.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.020
Autumn Bennett: Making sure that we don't
offend and we just sort of maintain this like neutral.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.260
You're just too afraid to take a
stance.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.740
Keli Carender: You know, saying things that
are found to be acceptable within a certain box.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.000
Duck: Opponents would argue that it's sugarcoating
or pandering to another group of people.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.100
Proponents would say that it's only what's right. It's
just basic human decency,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.580
that we treat others with respect.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.209
Greg Rickel: I really prefer to use the word,
the word “civility.”

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.569
Autumn: There's a difference between, you
know, being an asshole and just speaking what

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:42.161
could be truth. It is politically incorrect
to say that you can't change your gender.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.319
It is politically incorrect to say that Black
Lives Matter movement is racist. But I believe

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.880
those things to be true, and I don't believe
them to be insulting or mean.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.880
Mark Olsen: I think if we substituted like
being polite or politeness instead of politically correct.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.620
I think we might actually make some
progress.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.680
Jerrell: When people talk about being politically
correct, it's like, “You can't say it like that."

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.060
They don't say, “You shouldn't say that.” They don't say “You shouldn't think like that.”

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.500
You just can't say it like that.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.120
Rachael DeCruz: I go back and forth in my
mind about whether or not it's better to have

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.800
somebody be blatantly racist or just kind
of say the right things but then

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.960
actually be racist.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.680
Mark: I think people don't enjoy feeling that there's

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.640
restrictions on what they can and cannot say.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.140
Sean Riley: People talk about political correctness
derisively because it's

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.720
“What should I not say?”

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.080
And I would like to frame things around
well, how do I make sure I say things that

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.500
respect the dignity and the humanity of the
person in front of me. So it's not like avoiding

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.260
getting caught, but it's proactively engaging
with others and their dignity.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.480
Keli: I don't think that we should be putting
labels on whole vast parts of our language,

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:01.060
trying to make them unacceptable. When you take away free speech, I mean you, you kill a free society.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.020
Lucas Nydam: A lot of people say political
correctness is limiting free speech, but I

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.540
think like when people just dismiss criticism
as being politically correct and don't address it,

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.060
that's more limiting to free speech. Like,
people bring up like, “Hey you might be

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.420
being racist, whether intentionally or unintentionally.” And people are like “No, you're just being politically correct.”

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.840
And then they just dismiss that argument without ever really addressing it.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.120
Louis Chude-Sokei: Now, you're being checked,
they say “What do you mean by that? Wait

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.120
a minute, that's wrong. What about this?”
Right. And so the people who are most hostile

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.470
to this thing called politically correct are
people who don't like to be checked, right.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:43.870
And people who feel that their power and authority
is being whittled away by being checked.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.540
But what they were responding to was people saying
that look, not only do your words and ideas

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.569
have repercussions in the immediate world
around you, right. There are more and more

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:02.449
people who are feeling empowered to check
you. And that's what people are upset about.

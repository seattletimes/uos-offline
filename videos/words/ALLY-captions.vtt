00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.780
ALLY

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.460
Tariqa Waters: Oh man, just be somebody’s
friend! I don’t know….

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.420
Jerrell Davis: I don’t know, when I hear
“allies,” I think of war.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.880
Autumn Bennett: The term ally to me typically
applies to like, countries in war.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.840
Cynthia Tee: “Ally” is really somebody
in the privileged camp being able to champion

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.310
somebody who is not privileged or being targeted.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.619
Sean Riley: Someone who stands up for the
marginalized, knowing that there's probably

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:27.859
a social cost to that.

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.030
Mark Olsen: The way I understand that word
is it's somebody who is sympathetic or has

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.700
joined a cause that they feel that they normally
wouldn't because they're white. I really don't

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.539
like the word because it is very divisive.
It emphasizes these, these battle lines that we have.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.969
Autumn: So it's like we're using war terms
to determine like support of groups and that's

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.230
like, we've turned this into some sort of
social war.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.930
Mark: I don't think it's helpful, because
we're all in it together.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.509
Jerrell: People always seem to put it
on us. Like, “Black folk, y'all just need

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.199
to get y'all communities together, and then
you can rise.” It's like, bro, there's only

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.890
so many of us and we're living in a culture
that we don't control the output. We gotta

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.000
address the people that do, and they gotta
be on our team. We got to speak to the white folk.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.240
Rachael DeCruz: They're able to use their
privilege in that space to kind of, either

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.280
hold other people accountable, or have a different
kind of conversation. When it's coming from

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.010
another white person it's, people receive
it differently, it feels different, right?

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.790
It's coming from a peer.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.890
Marci Owens: We kind of get that stamp of
like, oh, a angry black man or black woman

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.660
again. But if a white person kind of steps
up, it kind of becomes just a different voice in the fight.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.640
Tariqa: I would have you know, you know, a
little more respect for the “White Privilege”

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.530
single that Macklemore dropped if he didn't
ask so many people of color to participate

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.270
in the song. Just do it, say it. Go out there
and say it by yourself. You've been in the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.900
world long enough to know the deal.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.980
Louis Chude-Sokei: Like, we made a joke in
media that is always like, that one of the best

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.870
jobs for black actors is the black best friend,
right, or the sassy black girlfriend, right?

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.680
The ally is like “the white friend,” the
righteous white guy, right? The down white girl.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.180
Keli Carender: I don't really have a lot of
experience with that word. I don’t know,

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.390
I would consider myself an ally of most people,
like, because I want everyone to have freedom.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.860
I believe in individual rights. I don't believe
in group rights. I believe every individual

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.740
has the same rights as every other individual.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.720
Ayn Rand said that the smallest minority is the individual.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.580
Greg Rickel: I can't claim I'm an ally. I think the people that need me as an ally are

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.860
the only ones that can say that I am one.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.000
What I'd hope to be is someone who listens more than talks.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.600
M. Lorena González: A good white ally will
give space to communities of color and leaders

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.570
within communities of color to set the agenda
and lead on the agenda.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.340
Leija Farr: Some white people will, like,
stand in the front and kind of like –

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.010
I mean, I know they're trying to support, but
you have to like let us take our actions.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.680
And then just be that support system that
we go to.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.400
Tariqa: Malcolm X said it best, “You can
help, but you can’t join.”

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.280
I was like “oh no…”

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.790
Varisha Khan: When you're from an underprivileged
group there's a lot of things that you wish

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.940
that someone from a position, someone from
a position of privilege will do to help you.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.890
Whether that's speaking in a certain way,
or whether that's not speaking at all.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.280
If you really truly do want to help, listen
to what we have to say.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.620
Marci: If you don't take the time to learn
about their struggle, I don't think you can

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.100
be properly be an ally or say you’re an
ally.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.569
Duck Bae: Be like, I'm here to listen. Please
tell me everything. I'm ignorant and I acknowledge it

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.630
and I'd like you to teach me.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.380
Darrell Hillaire: Willing to listen and understand
and stand up for each other's beliefs, you know,

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.860
even if we disagree, you know.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.360
Autumn: I don't support any type of victimhood.
So I think an ally is somebody who is like,

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.490
in some ways, feels like if they don't do
this they'll either be A, out of the group

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.180
or B, they're somehow bad for not supporting
something. And I think that's what happens

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.690
to a lot of people. They just feel like pressured
into it, because trust me. Not agreeing with

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.930
all this stuff is way harder than agreeing
with it.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.410
Keli: You should have this phrase on here:
"virtue signaling." I think that a lot of

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.759
people practice virtue signaling. So they
get to signal to other people that they are virtuous.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:23.330
Tariqa: If it's like a Beyonce or Macklemore
song, it’s easy to play and say “Yeah,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.220
I played it, I shared it, you know, I hashtagged
it, I'm done.”

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.380
Duck: Ally when it is used incorrectly is
slapping a term on yourself and being like,

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.120
“My job is now done. I'm an ally.”

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.480
Louis: It becomes a way of demonstrating your
moral and political rectitude, that you're

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.170
on the right side of history, because of who
you affiliate yourself with, right.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.770
It doesn't mean that you're doing work.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.480
Cynthia: There's a lot of really good intention.
And yet the gap between good intention and

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.700
the ability to be a strong ally is actually
a lot bigger than I think most people think it is.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.820
There's a lot to be learned that's
actually not very obvious.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.700

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
RACIST

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.120
Keli Carender: People today, the worst thing
you can possibly call a person is racist.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.320
Greg Rickel: When you hear the word racist,
what do you envision in your mind? Because

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.750
I think a lot of it is, you know a very extreme
version of what that is, instead of the very

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.359
subtle ways that we all do it, all participate
in it. All cause it to be real.

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.890
Cynthia Tee: I think the word racist just
gets thrown around a lot among all the kids,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.480
you know whether they actually understand
what it means is an entirely different story.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.320
Louis Chude-Sokei: I guess the classical definition
is a racist is someone who believes that

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.460
who you are, what you are capable of, everything
about you intellectually, spiritually, culturally,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.720
historically is due to your race.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.100
Michael Dixon: What makes people racist is
when they attach themselves

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.740
to an ideological movement. Us against them.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:07.360
Keli: Calling somebody a racist is saying
that, I mean, that their heart is just filled with hate.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.960
That they literally hate somebody
because of the way they look,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.880
because of their skin color. That they want to discriminate against them.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.580
A true racist is a very bad person.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.180
Duck Bae: Racism associated with being like,
bad and evil, and so you're never going to

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.789
admit to yourself that you're racist.

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:28.469
Greg: Well, I am a racist. I say I am a recovering one.

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.219
Being a white male from the South, you know,

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:39.749
I think I'm probably in the category
that's the ultimate racist. And being marinated

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:44.200
in that all your life you can't help but carry
that with you. And what I see a lot of white

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.999
people do is decide they're not a racist,
“They're not talking to me or about me.

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:56.020
We sure do need to do something about it.
But it doesn't include me because what they're

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.840
talking about is something else.” And I
think that's the biggest, I would call it, sin.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.480
I didn't really get to a place of dealing
with this until I was able to say I'm a racist.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.920
Keli: If you go out of your way to accuse
somebody of something that now has been defined

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.640
as a very dirty, horrible thing, they're going
to be very much less likely to come to the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.190
table and talk to you about things. Most of
the people in our country are good people.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.120
Right? Most people have good intentions, most
people are trying.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.130
Duck: Even if you associate racism with being
bad, and you yourself don't think you're a

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.580
bad person, you might still be part of the
problem.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.000
Autumn Bennett: If you're walking past a certain
part of town, like you feel a little more

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.360
conscious of your purse, you may lock your
doors. That's like this natural instinct we

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.670
have to protect ourselves.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:49.540
Michael: Like, I am a little intimidated to
be by myself walking down the street and say

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.220
there's a white woman come this way. If I'm
on the same sidewalk, I get as far over as I can.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.840
Because I know. And because those are
some of the fears that people have.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.940
Jerrell Davis: Everybody on earth has prejudice.
It's a survival tactic of human beings

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.770
Greg: You know when you're living in denial
that you're not a racist, then none of that

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.720
stuff is racism. “Oh I just made a mistake.
You know, I just made a mistake.”

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.660
Mark Olsen: I think you can say something
that is racist and it doesn't necessarily

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.160
mean that you are racist. And if I say something
that is racist and I don't mean to say it though.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.880
But somebody perceives it as racist. That doesn't make me then this big, white racist person.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.120
That makes me ignorant. And
maybe even stupid.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.300
Tariqa Waters: I'm not going to bite my tongue
anymore, I'm not going to just take it.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.820
I will call you out and say you know, “What
you're doing, you know, how you're addressing

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.570
me is racist.” And that gets scary in and
of itself because nobody wants to be called a racist.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.920
And I understand that, but don't
say racist things then. It's 2016;

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.360
you know when you're being racist, you know when you being ignorant.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:07.960
Mark: We tend to value perception and emotion
maybe over, kind of, facts.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.480
If we feel like it's racist then it must be, when I don't know that that's always the case.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.459
Keli: I think intent plays a lot into it.
I think about, like, murder charges. There's

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.840
manslaughter, right, versus murder.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.500
Rachael DeCruz: Regardless of whatever someone's
intent was, like, the outcome and how you

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:28.639
feel is what matters and if, you know, if
you feel you're being discriminated against

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:29.960
because of your race, that's real.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.270
Lorena Gonzalez: It could be that one time
when I went to go put in gas in a small Eastern

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.030
Washington town and the clerk refused to touch
my hand when I gave her money.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.219
Tariqa: You know, “How did you get this
place?” You know, “Oh my god, how do you

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:53.000
afford to live here?” And thinking I sell
weed. Blatantly overt racist remarks.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.960
I have not had it ever anywhere else but Seattle.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.340
Darrell Hillaire: Our kids at the Academy
being called niggers to their face

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.520
in school by white kids.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.400
Varisha Khan: People are leaving things at
our mosques, they’re leaving like pigs heads

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:16.100
and, you know, just people graffiti-ing, tagging
our schools, our, you know, Islamic schools.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.080
I don't know if I'm going to be inside a mosque
when it's going to be firebombed at any point.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.480
And people have been killed.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.800
Keli: I believe in freedom and I think people
have the freedom to be prejudiced people.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.710
It doesn't mean they're maybe going to have
very many friends or that they're going to

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.640
be very popular or they're going to get elected
to office.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.779
Autumn: I believe yes there is individuals
who will always be racist. There's always

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:36.909
assholes in every category. There's no way
you can eliminate that because that is eliminating

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:40.069
opinion and mindset and how people have grown
up.

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:43.729
Mark: What's funny is we tend to, we tend
when we think of people being racist, we think

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:49.509
of it as white people against non-white people,
or non-people [sic] as white people.

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:54.590
We don't, we don't often think of the different minorities
being racist against each other.

00:05:54.599 --> 00:06:00.059
Darrell: There's no such thing as like reverse
racism or, you know, white racism.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.580
Racism is racism.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.830
Greg: I don't agree with people that say that
everybody can be racist. I don't really buy

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.180
it because to me, race is really attached
to power and privilege.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:20.760
So in different societies it may be different, but I think in our society, white people have to own this more.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.820
Jerrell: I mean that's true. Yes I think it's
true that black people can't be racist.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:31.180
We can be hella discriminatory. We can be hella
prejudice. Yeah, but they can't be racist

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.141
because they don't have a system and a structure
and an institution that's attached to those

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.729
beliefs that give them a leg up in all situations.

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:45.669
Darrell: Racism is a is a result of ignorance.
When you think about ignorance,

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:49.049
what's missing from ignorance is empathy.

00:06:49.049 --> 00:06:56.209

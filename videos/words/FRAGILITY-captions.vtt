00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
WHITE FRAGILITY

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.760
Darrell Hillaire: I have no idea what that
means. White... fragility?

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.800
Leija Farr: Fragility makes me think about
something being, you know, easily broken.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.020
Greg Rickel: I don't know that as a term I've
heard, but when I read it I thought very much

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:22.730
of just how fragile white folks are when we
have this conversation. We fall apart in the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.680
face of any encounter with the thought that
we may be part of racism, or that we have

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.840
some part in playing in how to solve it.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.100
Cynthia Tee: The first thing that comes to
mind is maybe somebody who’s white who feels very

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.100
unjustly accused of having any privilege
or, or being racist or anything like that,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.600
purely based on the fact that they don't have
that intention.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.020
Louis Chude-Sokei: That's a real thing in
a place like Seattle, certainly.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.850
Sean Riley: Seattleites can be sort of fragile,
and I really do think we don't like discomfort

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.040
and we don't like conflict.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.040
Marci Owens: I think people are afraid to
be wrong about things, and that's why people

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.480
are so timid to talk about this.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.300
Michael Dixon: Well, I don't think white people
are fragile. I think they're ignorant.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.180
Lucas Nydam: I never got those skills of being
able to talk about race, and that's where

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.640
a lot of people are right now in our country.
They're just starting these conversations,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.710
so they're fragile. They can feel attacked
because they've never really had to think

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.720
about it. They'll feel so hurt because they
didn't realize things they were doing were

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.600
racist or supporting racist systems.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.180
Jerrell Davis: This need to be hella sensitive
when we're talking about race and ethnicity.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.880
Like, you would think it would be the people
that are being disenfranchised and held back

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.170
that would be the most sensitive, you know.
But no, it's the people that are benefiting

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.060
from it, that we have to like, water down
and sugarcoat terms,

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.680
“don't say white privilege, don't say white supremacy.”

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.300
Louis: It is the sense that all conversations
about race or inequity ultimately must be

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:05.549
had in such a way as to not threaten whites
because well-meaning whites often, you know,

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.670
see themselves as above the fray.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.360
Rachael DeCruz: I think a lot of conversations
around race and privilege and oppression,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.120
oftentimes people of color will make them
feel better or more digestible for white people.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.349
The point is to expose some stuff that's happening,
whether or not people want to hear it.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:30.480
Duck Bae: In the nation where you’ve always
been catered to, and you’ve never known

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.950
really about it, or stopped to consider it,
suddenly having people talk to you about it,

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.610
having people explain to you that you've been
advantaged all your life – could understandably

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:50.860
make someone fragile and unwilling to face
those new realities.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.920
Greg: Very quickly I would go to, “Oh, so,
so I'm to blame for all of this, you know

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.300
I was born in 1963. My parents were part of
the civil-rights movement, and you're blaming me?

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.540
I'm not a racist. I don't do, I don't tell bad jokes. Some of my best friends are black people.”

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.440
You know that's, that's fragility.
That's kind of – we race to that and kind of

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.739
want that to suffice, you know, to get
us off the hook.

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.920
Leija: Like when you're telling them, like
“This is what I'm going through,” and

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.129
they're like, "Well, why are you blaming this
on me?" Like, I'm not blaming, I'm not singling

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.900
you out. You know, I'm just telling you what
I'm going through. And I'm trying to have

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.440
you listen and, you know, they feel like you're attacking them.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.660
Like, "why are you attacking me?"

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.490
Darrell: We're trying to say this system is
messed up. You know, this system creates these

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.849
divisions amongst us, you know.

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.159
Autumn Bennett: Is it OK to feel uncomfortable?
Yes. Should they feel defensive or like they're

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:55.750
responsible for it all? No. Should they be
taking on the fragility and the guilt, or

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.269
whatever, of all of the previous racist white
people on the planet? No.

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.791
Marci: It's OK to be human. Like, it's OK to
make mistakes and it's OK to be wrong about things.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.819
But the one thing about being human
is that we learn.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:16.120
Varisha Khan: Someone who is used to privilege,
to them, equality will feel like injustice.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.580
When someone is so used to having a leg up
over someone else, now when someone else has

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.060
caught up to them, now you feel like you have
to share something, and you feel like,

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.280
suddenly you feel like you're losing something.

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.060
When the reality is you're just sharing the same space.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.920

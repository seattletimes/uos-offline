00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.890
Greg Rickel: I'd say in the white world we're
all over the map about what it means and whether

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.530
it's real or not. If you just bring up white
privilege,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.480
you've already got divisiveness in the room.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.420
Tariqa Waters: We've existed in it without
even knowing the word for it, I feel.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:29.500
M. Lorena González: White privilege is the
acknowledgment that our country has a

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:42.780
deep-seated conflict in history with race, and that that history has brought us to a place where white skin

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:51.440
affords you a greater amount of access to opportunity than if your skin wasn't white.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.220
Keli Carender: It almost seems like you're
accusing somebody of either not having good

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.730
intentions or of not deserving what they have
in life or not having worked for it.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.000
Rachael: You're not a bad person by benefiting
from white privilege. You didn't really have

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.429
any choice in the matter, but you do have
a choice in kind of how you engage with the world.

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:12.229
Jerrell Davis: And here's the thing about
not acknowledging white privilege, is that

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.209
you internalize that superiority.

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:19.240
Sean: I can look at the currency of our country
and everyone on the currency has the same

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:24.780
skin tone as me which reaffirms certain notions
about, about power. You can go to a hotel

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.500
and expect the, the shampoo to work with your
kind of hair.

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.060
Autumn Bennett: Hotel shampoo is crap. So
who cares. Black people can't get, like, black

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.590
Band-Aids and that's like white privilege.
Band-Aids? I mean come on, like it's that

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.880
these little things that I've heard.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.590
Tariqa: So my mom would braid my hair all
the time, and it was really long and I was

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.259
over at my grandmother's house. And I said,
you know, “I want to be white,” and she

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.880
said, and she almost slapped me across my
face, and she said “why?” I said “Because

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.179
I wouldn't have to braid my hair.” You know
like just the, these things of just being

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.119
able to be free in the world without all these
restrictions, I saw that as this oppressive thing.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.860
Rachael DeCruz: White privilege is the fact
that you don't have to think about your race.

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.080
And when you're not white, you do confront
that on a daily basis; you're reminded on a

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.280
daily basis that you're not white. Whether
it be seeing yourself represented in the political

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.960
structure, in the media, in our education
system.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.520
Cynthia Tee: When you're favored, sometimes
you just don't even really realize you're favored.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.320
Darrell Hillaire: You have no idea. That's
what white privilege means. You have no idea.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.940
Jerrell: Privilege itself is a concept, ain't
nobody gonna disagree that privilege exists,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.840
right? As a male I have privilege.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.800
Louis Chude-Sokei: There's male privilege,
there’s heterosexual privilege

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.380
Autumn: I don't have any, wait I do have privilege.
It's very confusing, I read the list of privileges

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.380
a while back and I just was like, “What!”
Like the able-bodied privilege and female privilege.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.860
Louis: And there's also the privilege of you
know being an American, first-world privilege.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.780
Even if you're from Rainier Flats, right? Or West Oakland.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.520
Keli: Anybody can be privileged, and I actually
think every group has certain privileges.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.220
Mark Olsen: I absolutely think there's privilege,
sure, sure. Different people are privileged

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.230
differently than other people. And I think
if you look statistically in America right

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.540
now, I think you would, I think we would find
that white people tend to be more privileged

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:26.820
than non-white people. With that being said
though I'm very hesitant to say there is white,

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.420
all white people are privileged, therefore
there is white privilege.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.840
Lucas Nydam: You can grow up poor and white
and still have white privilege, because it's

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.590
white privilege. Doesn't mean you’re privileged
in everything; it just means you're privileged

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.270
because of your race over people of other
races.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.360
Rachael DeCruz: So I think people sometimes when
they experience oppression in other areas

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.230
tend to not see the privilege that's in their
lives.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.180
Louis: We say you have white privilege to
someone who's working five jobs or someone

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.920
who can't get into this school. It doesn't
really communicate anything to them

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.020
and it just generates resentment.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.300
Sean Riley: I think my skin color enhances
my freedoms to and my freedoms from things.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:10.520
I don't have to worry about my skin color
being a detriment to getting a loan or to

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.100
my possibility of getting a job.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.760
Michael Dixon: White privilege means that
you can just be. The things that are available

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:27.139
to you, you can get. The things that are available
to me, sometimes I can get, sometimes I can't.

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.930
Varisha Khan: White privilege is being able
to speak out about your country, about your

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.850
government, about politics, without being
seen as unloyal or unpatriotic.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.819
Leija Farr: Look at the media and, like, look
at what images they show you as beautiful.

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.499
Look at what images they show you as powerful.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.460
Duck Bae: Since you don't look like this beautiful
ideal, and because that ideal happens to be

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.719
white, that is the cause of a lot of internalized
racism. Things like that make it difficult

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:01.739
to hold within you that kind of pride of the
unique beauty

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.900
that your race that you yourself hold.

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:07.979
Autumn: White people have had, like, such
a better chance in this world. Like no, actually,

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:13.229
because slavery was over a hundred years ago.
You weren't involved. None of us were. We

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.580
don't have to piggyback on a poor and bad
legacy.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:23.379
Louis: White privilege is the accretion of
history that whether you were involved in

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.780
it or not directly, has accrued over time
into your very sense of self

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.260
and manifests in how you relate to the world.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:40.860
Jerrell: When you give somebody historical
context, to me it's hard to deny the truth.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.980
And people that say they don't have white
privilege, like “I worked for everything

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:54.439
I got,” I mean, I think even that speaks
to white privilege. And this idea that we can

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:59.379
pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, like
that's just bullshit, like you better give

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.620
some credit to the people that are around
you because they help you survive.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.259
Lucas: Just talking with my stepdad in general,
he's like “Oh, I worked hard my whole life,”

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:14.439
and I'm like “I'm sure you did, but you
also started higher up on the ladder than

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:20.419
other people of other colors and other backgrounds.”
A lot of times people like to think that everything

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:26.319
we do is a result of our own actions, which
is not necessarily the case of course.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.580
Lorena: There is no question that white folks,
even those who come from a disadvantaged socioeconomic

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:40.530
background, have difficulties and challenges.
But when you are a person of color, those

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:47.980
struggles, those barriers, are deeper and more profound. And white privilege is an acknowledgment

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:55.939
that we are not starting at an equal place.
That communities of color need a head start,

00:06:55.939 --> 00:07:01.679
if you will, just to get to the same start
line that our white counterparts are at.

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.059
Keli Carender: Just seems like something The
Onion came up with. Just putting the word

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:11.140
micro in front of aggression because it's
not a big aggression, it's just a micro one.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:20.570
Louis Chude-Sokei: Microaggression is supposed
to be small, seemingly innocent, sometimes

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.169
unintentional, naive or ignorant interactions.

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:36.130
Mark Olsen: The things that are done unintentionally
that are,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.810
that can be viewed as derogatory, pejorative.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.220
Tariqa Waters: I think microaggressions are
bullsh- I'm sorry, I'm trying not to curse,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:49.980
but that is just, it's just too much of, you
know, just over explaining your ignorance.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.850
Microaggressions, I don't think that, when
you're receiving it, they're,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.050
they're not micro. I think it's easier for the person
who is doing it to use that term.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.760
Rachael DeCruz: Microaggressions to me are
sort of like those small little actions or

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.719
comments that communicate to people that they're
less than or aren't worthy.

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:11.409
Cynthia Tee: One of my black students, she
often gets approached and told that she's

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:20.770
very articulate. And so there's a microaggression
there, because it comes from people who just

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.310
unknown to them automatically assume that
a lot of black people are not very articulate.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.939
Rachael DeCruz: “You're so smart, you're
so eloquent” and I feel like the piece that

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.929
they're leaving off is like, “despite that
you're a woman of color.” “Oh, you're

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.899
standing out from this group of people that
I had previously thought something else of.”

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.380
Marcelas Owens: It’s like when people tell
me that I don't act like a regular black person.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.159
Tariqa: “Oh, you look like you came out
of the African gallery.” As beautiful as

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.920
you know my ancestry and my culture is, and
“Good for you working here. Good for you.”

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.899
A lot of that.

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.979
Sean Riley: They may not feel like much individually
but they, they add up. And to me they are

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:05.740
little fractures that, that spotlight racism.
We see that you do think another is inferior

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.829
or that you are superior.

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.070
Rachael: It’s traumatizing. And it's also
just kind of a constant reminder that the

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.200
world you walk in and you live in wasn't made
for you, and isn't always safe for you.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.590
Varisha Khan: It makes me feel like I don't
belong in the country that I was born in.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.340
Microaggressions to me are asking wouldn't
I like to let my hair down just once, or wouldn’t

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.060
I like to wear a swimsuit on a beach just
once. I'm suddenly reminded that I'm not seen

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.180
for my character, or for my actions, or for
how good I am as a person. Rather, I'm just

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.500
seen for the headscarf that's on my head.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.300
Autumn Bennett: If I say “Oh, like I can
definitely see that you may be Asian, because

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.150
I can tell like, by your eyes.” Is that
a microaggression?

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.770
M. Lorena González: You think you're giving
a compliment but you're really not.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.270
Rachael: It's like, “Oh, you're so exotic
looking.”

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.650
Leija Farr: Like, when a guy will tell me
that I'm pretty. And then he'll say like,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.520
um, "Oh, so what are you mixed with?" And
I'm like, "Um, I'm black." That's a microaggression.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.540
Like they're basically trying to tell you
that just being pure black, you can't be beautiful,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.980
you have to be mixed with something.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.680
Autumn: People ask me all the time like, “What
nationality are you?” And I'm like, “Well,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.150
you know my mom is Syrian and Czechoslovakian
and my dad was Haitian, and I think that's

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.670
frigging cool.” What if people are just
like, being curious?

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.630
Varisha: People ask us if, you know, we do
speak English. They'll kind of talk slowly

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.540
and try to make sense of the words we're saying,
or it's as if they're trying to process the

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.040
fact that we actually are speaking fluent
English. This is my first language.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.540
Keli: When we think of the word "aggressive"
I think that that is, you know, deliberate

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.150
to make it seem like it's a little bit more
than offensive, like it's almost a physical

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.600
attack, you know, almost like they're touching
you.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.100
Jerrell Davis: When I was at SPU, I used to
have a Afro. Kids would come up behind me

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.750
and touch my hair. Like no permission, I don't
know them, come up behind me, and touch my

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.780
hair. And I turn around and slap their hand
away, I’m like “What are you doing?”

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.210
They're like, "it's just so soft. It just
looks so soft, I just wanted to touch it."

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.750
Look, let me come up behind a white girl and
start touching her hair.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.370
I'm locked up with the quickness.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.770
Leija: Some people might see that as, like,
nice, but I really don't. I feel like that

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.090
is kind of offensive to, like, ask somebody,
can you touch their hair. Like if their hair

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.329
is in a style that you're not used to.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:28.370
Tariqa: It's this weird, you know like, fetish,
weird thing that white people have with our

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.920
hair that's absolutely, I don't know what
it is.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:40.790
Lorena: A couple years ago during Halloween
was parking my car in a garage in downtown,

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:48.120
and this older white gentleman saw me get
out of my car, and he's very, very social.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:57.650
And he asked me what they call Halloween in
my country. And I told him, “Well, they

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:08.530
call it Halloween, because this is my country.”
To be honest I cared less about how he felt

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:15.250
about being the microaggressor and more about
how it made me feel.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.310
It's about the impact, and not about the intent of the person who, who engaged in that behavior.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:30.370
Keli: We've gone really far in saying it's
all about what the person receiving it thinks

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.760
that it means.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.770
Autumn: I also think it has to do with like,
people just not really having like a backbone.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.530
And I think we've become this society where
these like, kids are these like, delicate

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.570
orchids that just wilt once they leave the
greenhouse, they just die.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.810
Tariqa: I'd rather for them to just call me
a nigger, because it would have been easier

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.200
to take. It's easier to take just you know,
just overt, you know, just racial slurs than

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:01.410
the way people try to dress it up as not being
a racial exchange at all.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.889
Keli: I don't know, it just seems, it just
seems ridiculous, and there's just like so

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.490
many things to remember now that you're not supposed to say, you can't do, you can't think it.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.740
it.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.270
every little thing I say and do? It feels
very painful, it feels very tedious to do that.”

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:21.230
And my response to that is “Yes.
For you now finally in your adult life to

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.560
that.” And my response to that is “Yes.
For you now finally in your adult life to

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:36.060
experience this effort, it's about time, because
the people that you have done this microaggression

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.300
to have experienced it all their lives.”

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.440
Louis: People who are hostile to the notion
of microaggressions assume that games are

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.460
being played. Assume that this is actually
driven by specific political agendas. It's

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:56.419
the victim card. I think people don't understand that
there's actually pain there. I'm really split on

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:01.639
the issue of microaggressions. You know, because
I don't want to deny anyone's pain, but I

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:10.699
also don't, can't imagine a world where interacting
with difference is done without pain.

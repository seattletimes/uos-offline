00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.959
INSTITUTIONAL RACISM

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:05.930
Jerrell Davis: We hold these truths to be
self-evident that all men are created equal.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.130
You know, when they say all men, they weren't
talking about all men.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.270
Tariqa Waters: We've been getting shot by
the police since they let us off, out of shackles.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.560
I mean, and then there is that: slavery. I
mean, I don't understand why we're talking

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.589
about race and racism like it's something
that just popped up.

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.259
Lucas Nydam: Growing up as a white person
in a purely white town, you only hear about

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.129
individual racism. Systemic racism is where
I see a lot of people who don't really understand.

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.649
A lot of people can try to dismiss it, but
it's hard to dismiss systemic racism because

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.429
it's math, it's data. People with white-sounding
names getting higher rates of callbacks on

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.380
jobs, you have prison rates, you have housing
discrimination.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.440
Cynthia Tee: The percentage of black people
among those that are incarcerated is really high,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.120
like the data is there, you can't deny
that there is some institutional racism going on there.

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.899
Mark Olsen: You know, all these different
statistics, the statistics are great, but

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.149
they mean nothing without the context. If
African American kids are more likely -- or

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:13.810
less likely to do as well as white kids, I
think we have to look at what, what causes

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.360
that, why, what is their environment, what’s
their family life like, what are the other

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.630
things that are affecting that.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.370
Autumn Bennett: In order to say that there
is an actual problem, we have to quantify

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.900
it with actual, measured proof. And so this
idea that we have this feeling that this is happening,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.160
I'm sure it's happening somewhere,
probably is happening.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.540
Black people are being arrested on a higher level, I don't agree.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.440
I think they may be committing crimes at a higher rate with a smaller demographic.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.740
I don’t know if that’s right.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.020
Louis Chude-Sokei: I don't care where you're
from, the numbers are staggering, in terms

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.700
of the amount of black people getting shot
by police, the incarceration rate.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.420
Even if we admit that “black people are more criminal”
– I'm not saying we should admit that – but

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.689
even if we do, the numbers are still out of
control, right. The numbers do not even add

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.780
up to greater criminality, statistically.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.520
Keli Carender: Institutional racism implies
that there are different laws for different people,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.760
and there are no longer different
laws. The law's the law and it's now applied equally.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.360
I mean, you know, you would hope.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.360
Rachael DeCruz: There's nothing necessarily
in any of our policing policies that says

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.850
you should be targeting people of color. But
the outcome, right, we know that the outcome

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.990
is that people of color are more likely to
be stopped, they're more likely to be arrested,

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.150
they're more likely to be sentenced, they’re
more likely to have longer sentences.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.260
Greg Rickel: That alone ought to tell us we've
got a problem. So we don't have to have laws

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.440
that enact it, or at least direct blatant
laws. We've got a system now that's built

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.980
to keep that and to make it go.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.630
M. Lorena González: They're a legacy of what
once were really overt discriminatory acts,

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.950
like preventing African Americans or any other
person of any other race from buying property

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:05.260
in a particular part of town. Predatory lending
and access to education and where schools

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.600
are built, where grocery stores are built.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.900
Rachael: It's often not like a bunch of evil
people sitting around in a room being like

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.390
“We're going to, you know, we're going to
take all we can from this group of people.”

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.420
It's often, the policies are written in a
way that doesn't sort of encompass the disparities

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.700
that currently exist and so they then further,
further those disparities.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.120
Mark: There have absolutely been examples
of institutionalized racism. Yeah. Goodness,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.290
Nazi Germany, and I think even in American
history we've had institutionalized racism,

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.200
150 years ago, and so I'm not saying that
there is no institutionalized racism. It's

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.060
that right now I'm not sure that what we are,
what we are saying is institutionalized racism,

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.320
I don't know that that's the right, that's
the right phrase for that.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.830
Autumn: I mean like when I was using in the
streets like I got stopped for stuff I didn't

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.980
do. But to say that it's this widespread systemic
thing. I just, I don't know. I know I stopped

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.190
having trouble with the police, though, when
I quit breaking laws.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.310
Jerrell: I think that most people are speaking
from experience. There has to be some historical,

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.340
educational perspective.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:19.160
Lorena: We live in a country that is founded
on really deep-seated, bad history around race,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.460
from slavery to the Mexican-American
War to the colonization of America and what

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:30.330
that represents for our Native American community.
Every slice of history that you look at in

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.750
America has some sort of relation to, to race,
and oppression based on race, and exclusion

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.710
based on race.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.979
Louis: People either don't have the historical
context or deliberately do not want to have

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:48.599
the context. But you’ve distanced yourself
from the history of racism, you're able to

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:49.870
not think of it as racism.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.389
Darrell Hillaire: If we don't know our history
then we're bound to be ignorant about how

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.620
we treat one another. We need to teach the
kids about slavery in the school system to

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.780
say that this is really wrong. So they're
not raised in such a way that, you know, that

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.669
all is just kind of like a blind spot.

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:14.840
Greg: It's privilege plus power in a society.
And that can be different from any society,

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.909
but in ours it happens to be white.

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:24.560
Jerrell: Racism is prejudice with privilege.
It's structural, it's hereditary. And hereditary,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:31.860
not like genetically, but you pass on the
values that are rooted in racism to your children,

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.509
and that affects how they treat other people.

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.569
Darrell: You go through the angry phase, and
you go through the protest phase in your life,

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:43.379
and then you go through this place where you're
just kind of numb, you know, it's like, you

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:50.080
know this is getting worse than better, you
know. But you just have to take it upon yourself

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.220
to educate as many people as you can.

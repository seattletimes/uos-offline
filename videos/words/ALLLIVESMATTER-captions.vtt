00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.980
Leija Farr: "Black Lives Matter? What about
all lives? All lives matter." That's what

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.640
people always say. Your cries for help don’t
matter, basically, that’s what I hear.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.360
Marci Owens: When you say “all lives matter”
you're kind of trying to avoid the problem

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.869
of race and you kind of don't want to talk
about race, so you’re trying to say

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:16.840
“all lives matter.”

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:26.540
Jerrell Davis: If you're offended by me saying
me and people that look like me matter,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.060
why does that offend you? Why does that upset you?

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.290
Lucas Nydam: I think it's just probably a
combination of fragility and not really understanding

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.430
systemic racism, is why I think people respond
to that. And it's like I mean no one, no one,

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.850
like, no one's going to disagree that all
lives matter.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.560
Mark Olsen: By default I think most people
say, “Well, if you're saying Black Lives

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.430
Matter, what about everybody else?” Honestly
I've yet to hear anybody say “white lives

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.000
matter” as the counter, it's “all lives
matter,” which is actually pretty inclusive

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.320
to other minorities as well.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.980
Tariqa Waters: That's white privilege, “All
lives matter.” Of course all lives matter.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.220
All lives aren't getting shot up in the streets
by the police!

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.240
Louis Chude-Sokei: I think that there are
people who genuinely did not know that Black

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.630
Lives Matter is specifically about police
violence and criminal incarceration. Or they

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.749
just saw the term, then said, “Oh, you're
privileging black lives above others.” Right,

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:21.030
and this a part of the larger discourse of
racism and white privilege, you know, for

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.079
example, “Why do you have African-American
History Month? Well, why don't we have a white-history

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.439
month?” Clearly there's a history that they
do not know or don't want to know.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:37.619
Jerrell Davis: Like, we have to explain why
it's wrong that 12-year-olds are getting gunned down.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.319
Why do I have to explain that to someone?

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:47.209
Mark Olsen: I see both sides of it. I understand
the idea that black lives matter. I understand.

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:52.589
I can't, I can't relate to that because I'm,
I'm not, I'm not black.

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:57.560
Keli Carender: I think that the Black Lives
Matter movement has some legitimate complaints.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.439
Libertarians for decades have been pushing
criminal justice reform. But again I think

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.919
the way that it's been implemented has been
very anti-speech and anti-thought.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.720
Mark: I think some people are frustrated at
you know, actually at the Black Lives Matter

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.750
movement because they don't, I think some
people perceive it as not being helpful. People

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.349
walking on the freeways and, and you know,
smashing things. They go, “How is that helpful?

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.849
How is that bringing us together as a community?
That's only dividing people.”

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.360
Greg Rickel: This is where Black Lives Matter
to me is so important, because they are attempting

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.510
to speak. And to have us listen. And instead
of us trying to jump to “all lives matter”

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.769
or you know, let's figure out – I think
it's just our place to listen and to try to

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.409
follow a little bit, too.

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:50.519
Cynthia Tee: I remember being really surprised
when it came up. “All lives matter.” Because

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.420
it's such an obvious thing that all lives
matter. But that's just not the point.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.530
Rachael DeCruz: The way like, reframing like
that has been used is a way to kind of not

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.829
have the conversation about race, and to not
have a conversation about how black people

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:07.260
in this country are being treated, and how
we're, how we allow ourselves to live with that.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.370
Darrell Hillaire: You see their response to
it, it’s like viewed as a threat. Instead

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.269
of saying “Yeah, you're right, you know,
those things are wrong and in this history

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.189
there's a lot of things wrong.” It's easier just
to say, “Well, all lives matter.”

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:23.930
Michael DIxon: They figure that they need
to add that addendum, not to strengthen the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.520
idea, but to dilute it.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.880
Jerrell: I can't believe that anyone that,
that responds to Black Lives Matter with

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:38.840
“all lives matter” truly believes that all lives
matter. Because if you did, you'd be sitting

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.840
here. You'd be protesting with us. Black Lives
Matter does not stand in isolation. It's not

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.379
something that was created out of thin air.
Black Lives Matter comes from the civil-rights

00:03:51.379 --> 00:04:00.139
movement. It comes from the continued pursuit
of equitable treatment for people of color,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.820
all people of color.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.080
Michael: When you say "Black Lives Matter"
you're saying "all lives matter."

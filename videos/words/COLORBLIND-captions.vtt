COLORBLINDNESS

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.100
Leija Farr: I think it's funny when people
say that, like, "I'm colorblind I don't see color."

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.340
Like, of course you see color.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.360
Rachael DeCruz: Colorblindness to me means
denying the fact that racism exists and racism

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.320
still impacts us.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:20.160
Mark Olsen: I believe that all people are
wonderfully and fearfully made, and diversity

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.750
is a part of God's creation. If it's kind
of well, we need to stop you know stereotyping

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.439
based on different colors. If that's colorblindness,
okay I can see what they're saying there,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.780
but I think if we're going to talk about true
colorblindness I don't I think that does a disservice.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.200
Because we're ignoring a major
parts of people's lives.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.860
Greg Rickel: I think there's a richness in
our diversity. And I think colorblindness

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.490
kind of tries to erase that and it's also
a jump to denial.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.100
It's a way to put the conversation at rest.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.600
Louis Chude-Sokei: It's become a bad word.
There was a time when it was the goal.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.959
Darrell Hillaire: I think that's a good word,
you know, I think that’s a good word when

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:07.679
we reach that point of colorblindness. And
you don't see race; you see a person.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.219
Varisha Khan: Yes it's a great idea, like
it's a great goal is a great vision to have.

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:15.509
Like, let's be in a world where we don't have
to worry about differences, to truly value

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.509
each other for just our character, for just
our personality, for just our experience,

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:26.229
would be a great thing. I'd love to see that
one day. But the reality is we're, you know,

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.320
in a world that does see a difference.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:37.219
Keli Carender: I think a lot of people were
raised to not, to not take color as the main

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:43.090
thing about a person. It's really jarring,
I think, and very hard to understand why somebody

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:50.409
would want to have everyone pay attention
to what color they are, when you've worked

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.160
your whole life to try to make sure that people
are treated equally regardless of color.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.159
Louis: There are a lot of white people who
are indeed colorblind because they were taught

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.600
by black people to be -- (laughs) that this
is a good thing. And so, they don't realize

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.229
that well, no you were taught by one segment
of the black political world to be. There

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.510
are other segments that believe quite different
things. It's an it's an older solution (laughs)

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.190
right? It’s an older solution that has become
a problem.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.500
Duck Bae: Being colorblind essentially means
that we're trying to homogenize everyone that we see.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.380
So it might be a noble, noble effort
in some cases but homogenization of any culture

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.600
inevitably has us slowly drifting towards
being the white ideal.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.640
Jerrell Davis: Like if you're saying, “oh
I don't see you as black, I just see you as Jerrell."

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.400
Like no bro, I want you to see
me as black, like that's why I got dreadlocks,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.180
that's why you know I'm saying like, that's
why I talk like this, that why I wear my Africa

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:59.739
gear, you know like, I'm proud to be what
I am. And people that, say they're colorblind

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.900
or say that they don't see that, I think that
that speaks more to their internal struggle

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.940
than it does to the external.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.180
Varisha: It's almost as if it comes from a
place of discomfort, and you know, as if I

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.819
don't want to hear about race, and as if it's
a problem that we have different races and

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.319
we have different backgrounds.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.280
Lucas Nydam: Even if for some reason you were
completely colorblind, it wouldn't matter

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.599
because the schools see color, the jails see
color, like with systemic racism you don't

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.549
even have to see color because the systems
we've made will see color for you.

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.730
Cynthia Tee: I don't think anybody can truly
be colorblind. I don't think being colorblind

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.200
as a person actually exists.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.420
Tariqa Waters: If you just meet me, you know
you'd better not come out your mouth and say

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.170
“I don't see color.” Unless you're in
this just utopia of “race doesn't exist

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.609
anymore and we're just all one...” I always
like to refer to it as like the movie “Avatar.”

00:03:58.609 --> 00:03:59.870
We’re just gonna be blue.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.969
Jerrell: It's self defeating. Like, “I'm
colorblind, I don't see the fact that we're

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.620
all different.” You just said that we're
all different.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.189
Autumn: Kids see different colors of skin.
Babies see it. I can tell when I meet a baby

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:15.129
that has not seen a black person before because
they're like “Oh!” It’s just this reaction

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.570
and it’s super weird. Overall sure, it doesn't
matter what race someone is, but do we see

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.420
it? Absolutely and it's beautiful, it's really
cool.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.940
Duck Bae: I have no idea what I'd rather have
the term be rather than “colorblind.”

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.660
Color thoughtful? Colorminded? I have no idea.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.880
Colorblindness doesn’t stop to think about accommodations that might need to be made for races.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.330
Cynthia: I used to struggle a lot with this
notion of why you need to treat people differently,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.260
like why? If we're all equal you shouldn't
have to treat anybody differently. But now

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.100
I've come around to the other side where is
realizing that if the environment you're in

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.260
is fundamentally biased, you do need to treat
people differently, like you just do.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.190
Keli: I think you can be a person that says
I'm colorblind because I treat everyone equally

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.720
regardless of their skin color and still be
completely, you know and still understand

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.660
that people have different experiences or
cultures or whatever.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.960
Michael Dixon: It's a false premise. Everybody
is conscious of color. They just don't understand it.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:22.040

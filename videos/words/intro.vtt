00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.820
Michael Dixon: Seattle's supposed to have
this liberal image. And it's not.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.740
Tariqa Waters: Sometimes I feel like it's
1954. People feel really empowered just to

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.860
say it out loud and just announce their ignorance.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.440
Louis Chude-Sokei: Seattle is, is gentle. You're
not necessarily going to encounter

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.160
extreme hostility. You're going to encounter many
layers of subtlety.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.100
What that also means is that it's under your skin annoying.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.720
M. Lorena González: If you're talking about
race and you're not uncomfortable, you're

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.880
probably not having the right conversation.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.380
Darrell Hillaire: There’s tension attached
to this conversation.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.640
Jerrell Davis: It's unfortunate that we consider
it difficult conversations to have.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.980
Greg Rickel: We throw out the word race or
racism, and people I think

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.320
hear that in so many different ways.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.300
Keli Carender: I think a lot of people are
scared to be called a racist or of using or

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.109
exploiting their white privilege or causing
a microaggression or whatever it is.

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.329
Duck Bae: All of these terms just contribute
to an oversimplification.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.140
Lucas Nydam: We'll often just give them their
own meaning, kind of make them just buzzwords.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.360
Louis: A lot of these terms are constantly
used but never really unpacked, and people

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.780
are interpreting them in quite different ways
than the people who are speaking them.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.380
Autumn Bennett: So like, maybe we do take
a tiny bit of time to define what we mean.

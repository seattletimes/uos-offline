SAFE SPACE

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:09.740
Cynthia Tee: A safe space is where you feel
like you can do something or say something

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.440
and not be harmed as a result.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.220
Marci Owens: And when you know that you're
not going to be attacked for thinking a certain way,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.800
you are more open to let your ideas out
and kind of tell how you're really feeling.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.880
We can kind of be real about things.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.200
Lucas Nydam: The most real conversations I've
had about race, or any, or gender, anything,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.940
have happened in safe spaces. Like people
are like, “Oh you're coddling, you're not

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.780
talking about these things.” It's like no,
safe spaces allow people to talk about those things,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.340
when you set these ground rules to
try to make people comfortable.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.020
Rachael DeCruz: And by comfortable I mean
that I'm not fearing being discriminated against,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.159
harassed, bullied, that I just feel like I
can speak my mind and I'm not going to be

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:52.339
judged in any way for it.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.140
Sean RIley: It isn't absent of constructive
tension or conflict.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.799
Tariqa Waters: That's the safe space for me,
I think you know, just to be able to express

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.570
what it is that I'm saying, and if I stumble,
or if I said something that's out of turn

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.939
or inappropriate, that you just check me on.

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:18.520
Jerrell Davis: Thinking about safe spaces,
I would define them as places of comfort where

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.620
there are like-minded people.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.840
Duck Bae: As I understand it's like a ban
on saying anything hateful?

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.340
Varisha Khan: Safe spaces are environments
where people who do face racism, prejudice

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:41.340
of any sort, can truly feel comfortable and
feel safe that they will not face racism,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.440
prejudice, hatred, discrimination, microaggressions.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.340
Keli Carender: It sounds like, from their
own words, that they're asking for a place

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.439
where certain ideas and opinions and words
and phrases cannot be uttered or thought.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.259
And I think that if you only feel safe when
you're around people who think exactly like you,

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.019
then there is something very, very wrong.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.579
Autumn Bennett: That's what I kind of thought
the safe space was, was where it's only kind

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.000
of one point of view is allowed here. But
if you meant like a safe space where everyone can disagree,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.019
my response would be, well isn't
that kind of everywhere?

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.700
Keli: From reading quotes and interviews with
people who support these things, it seems like

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:29.860
it's a place where a certain opinion
and a certain thought is the only one that's okay.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.540
Because otherwise you're going to traumatize
people.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.500
And that's very, seems very authoritarian to me.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.080
Louis Chude-Sokei: There are people who say
that safe spaces stifle free speech.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.480
But that argument tends to not realize that speech can only be free

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.980
when everyone involved in the conversation feels equally empowered.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.360
Duck: People thinking about what they're saying,
and whether or not they should be saying it,

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.489
and being more conscious of their actions.

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:05.500
Rachael: We are living in a, in a white-dominated
society. And so people who fall outside that

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.739
norm need to have spaces to go to have conversations
with people who understand their experiences

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.479
and who aren't trying to minimize the pain
or the trauma that they're feeling.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.180
Leija Farr: So a safe space is like somewhere
you that you're going and finding similarities

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.760
with people when you feel like society is
like working against you.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.640
Tariqa: You know, we've always had to do things
in secret to survive, through slavery with

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.069
quilting and just, you know, just in how we
communicated with one another.

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.510
Louis: Although in my really sardonic moments,
I can make fun of people for being too thin-skinned

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.689
and kind of you know namby-pamby. But I know
what it was like to be a student, and I know

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:44.709
what it's like to be a minority in a largely
white environment, where people around you

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.790
aren't at all aware of the tension that they
generate towards you.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.510
Lucas: When you go into your typical university
classroom as like a white man, you're already

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.990
in your safe space. That space was made for you to be safe, like it was made with you in mind.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.640
So when other people, people of other
backgrounds go into it,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.739
the space wasn't necessarily made for them

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.959
Jerrell: We grow out of discomfort, and so
if we're always trying to be in a safe space,

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.720
we ain't never gonna grow, you know. If we're
always around people that are likeminded and

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.960
have the same thoughts as us, we’ll never
hear something that will challenge us

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.660
or challenge our way of thinking.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.980
Keli: The world is not a safe space. You have
to be able to be okay with yourself enough

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.480
to know that you aren't right all the time.
And that other people have other opinions

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.780
from you and, oh my god, they disagree.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.160
Lucas: People who aren’t familiar with safe
spaces I don’t think realize that it's not

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.780
a place where everybody gets what they want.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.580
It's where everyone acknowledges what other people need.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.260
Michael Dixon: Maybe just act like human beings
towards one another,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.800
and that's what I would consider a safe space.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.880

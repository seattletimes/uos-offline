00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
PERSON OF COLOR

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.620
Cynthia Tee: Person of color, for me, means
not white.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.660
Varisha Khan: A person of color is someone
who, I guess very simply is not white.

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:09.740
Jerrell Davis: People know what we mean, we
mean that we ain't white.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.040
Lorena Gonzalez: Person of color is an inclusive
term that I think provides a less pejorative

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:24.259
way to define minority. I don't like the word
“minority” because it immediately has

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.300
a sense of disempowerment.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.030
Jerrell: Even that term, the term “minority,”
is so like contextually based. Because like

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.970
on Earth, there’s way more people of color
than there are white people. Like 80 percent

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.770
of Earth are people of color. Like, let's
embrace our differences without having to

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.180
like create labels that have like this contextual
superiority or inferiority to them.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.640
Darrell Hillaire: Yeah, it was embarrassing
as a kid. You're made to feel embarrassed

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.140
for being a person of color. That means somebody's
looking down on you.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.550
Autumn Bennett: I think it's just like a way
to like avoid saying black, because suddenly

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.730
black is offensive. People stumble when they
try to say, you know like, “Oh, she's Bl... Afr…”

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.680
I'm black! I feel like it's like
taking over where "colored" left off.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.680
Jerrell: Like bro, I'm not a load of laundry.
It's like, do you wanna be colored, called colored.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.540
Like look, if somebody called me
colored, if a white person call me colored,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.100
we're having a problem.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.640
Michael Dixon: Don't call me that. I'm black.
Don't call me African American. Because I'm black.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.939
Those are political terms.

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.520
Tariqa Waters: To say I'm black and to then
identify other people as people of color are

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.329
two very separate things. For a white person
to say a person of color, it’s really easy

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.030
to just, it's a politically correct term that
is getting overused. And that's here in Seattle.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.760
I go to Atlanta, I'm black, you know, I go
to D.C. I'm black.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.920
Greg Rickel: I have to admit I struggle with
what terms to use and when. And you know there's

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.780
some impersonality in saying “person of
anything.”

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.400
Tariqa: There's just such a wealth of that
that gets overlooked and generalized in the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.709
term “person of color.”

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.840
Louis Chude-Sokei: Person of color is a term
that I know I gravitate more to than black,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.909
simply because even within the black world
there are people who are black who don't see

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:25.590
themselves as black because black means African
American. And so person of color is a broader,

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.629
more inclusive term.

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:33.310
Lorena: I don't think it's intended to devalue
what your own self-identification might be.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.329
I think it's more of a construct to recognize
we share more in common in terms of oppression

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.590
and difficulties in accessing opportunity
as a collective.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.989
Rachael DeCruz: I identify as a woman of color.
I feel like I fit into a pretty unique, privileged

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.180
space in the world, because you look at me
and you know that I'm not white, right? But

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.110
you don't know exactly what I am. My skin
color like is seen as less threatening than

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.640
someone who's darker than me.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.560
Duck Bae: I personally don't identify as a
person of color, because I think it comes

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.120
with inherent disadvantages that I myself
haven't faced in the same way. Sure, there

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.730
are disadvantages with being Asian American
but they, quite literally, pale in comparison.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.819
They tend to be oddly much more positive things.
And I haven't been associated with, I don't

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.680
think anyone's ever associated me with a life
of crime.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.469
Jerrell: It conflates all non-white people,
and so then people assume that like there's

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:38.909
a blanket experience of all people of color.
Like “Oh you're Korean, I’m black, we

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.189
being held down by the man.” And she’s
like, “Not really.”

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:49.599
Duck: It also might be my way of conveniently
distancing myself from everything. If I don't

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:56.739
tie myself into it, if I put myself on the
side of advantage, then it kind of enables

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.819
me to kind of break away from the conflict
between black and white and I'm like, oh no

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.019
guys, this isn't for me like I'm not a person
of color. And if I'm not a person of color

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:14.499
then I guess I might just end up an aggressor
or a bystander that chooses to do nothing

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:15.930
about changing the status quo.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.209
Cynthia: Chinese people I think in general
when it comes to issues of racism, even if

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.870
we have a lot of cultural institutional racism
ourselves, tend to be like kind of neutral

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.580
in this particular space all the time. Being
a person of color, meaning non-white, helps

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.150
me identify with not being part of the majority.
But I'm not necessarily a minority either.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.430
Autumn: It doesn't really help if you're trying
to, like you know, ID a suspect or something

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.250
like that. Like that's kind of vague, “It
was a person of color!” White people still

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.880
have color to their skin, like there's olive
shades and really porcelain shades and all in between.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.940
Darrell: We're all people of color, every
one of us.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.639
Greg: You know, I could argue in an abstract
way that we, you know, we're all colorful

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.180
people and we're all persons of diversity.
We have a lot of richness in each one of us.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.360
But we all know what it means when we hear
that. It's somebody not white. And so I struggle

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.930
with it a little bit, but I have to admit
I use it, just because it seems like a term

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.480
that works in discussion and I don't know
that it's right, but I do use it.

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:09.840
M. Lorena González: Diversity is one of these
words that has become very watered down to

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.519
mean just about anything that you can think
about.

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:19.199
Louis Chude-Sokei: Diversity is something
that is often said and asked for. But like

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.619
all the other terms, the meanings have never
been fully established.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.360
Keli Carender: What it seems to mean is looks.
We have a black person, we have a white person,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.960
we have a Hispanic person, we have a female,
you need this many people from this race and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.080
this many women and this many, whatever.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.880
Varisha Khan: Diversity means coming from
anything that's different, any walk of life

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.820
that's different. So that includes race, that
includes religion.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.800
Cynthia Tee: ...can be gender identification,
can be sexual orientation, can be

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.740
disability or ability.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.140
Marci Owens: ...not just races, like people
coming from poor families and people coming

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.540
from rich families and middle class.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.600
Mark Olsen: Diversity is also defined by ideology,
by religion, by, by thought process.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:18.260
Lorena: I think to me diversity has to be
rooted in race, ethnicity and, and gender.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.320
And I limit it to those categories very intentionally,
because really what we're talking about is

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:31.780
including people in an environment where they
have not historically been included.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.399
Mark: I think we have to be really careful
with how we define diversity. If there's a,

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.159
you know a city council full of people of
many different races and stuff but they all

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.339
think the same way, that doesn't make it a
diverse city council.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.420
Louis: The difficulty with Seattle is that
diversity and privilege and these issues become

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:56.039
largely intellectual exercises, and people
don't actually spend a whole lot of time just

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.679
in a place where they're, where they're on
someone else's terms. In a place where English

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.929
isn't the primary language, right? In a place
where your norms and expectations are turned

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.020
upside down.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.300
Leija Farr: Diversity is just like, going
outside of your boundaries of what you feel

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.980
is like comfortable, and like, seeing different
things.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.260
Duck Bae: Exposing yourself to people you
have very little in common with and having

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.820
to make that extra effort to find things you
do have in common with them. And that's a

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.670
very scary thing. Even in some of the most
diverse cities of America you'll ultimately

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.660
see that people gravitate towards people they
have a lot of similarity with.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.070
Michael Dixon: I don't want to be diversified
out of existence. The downside of diversity

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.090
is gentrification.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.320
Louis: The world is diverse but the professional
worlds are becoming increasingly segregated.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.000
I've had much trouble over the years trying
to explain to African-American people that

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.780
diversity means more than just white people
hiring you.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.970
Autumn Bennett: What if the two people have
the exact same qualifications, like then how

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.190
do, I mean, are they supposed to choose a
minority? So if there's a black guy and a

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.580
white guy and they have the same qualifications
is the, is the person supposed to choose the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.420
black guy? I mean how does that work out.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.960
Rachael DeCruz: I feel like a lot of decisions
are made assuming that the playing field is

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:14.530
level and equal, and they're not. Oftentimes
our country's focus on the individual and

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.750
this narrative of like, “pull yourself up
by your bootstraps. You work hard and you

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.640
play by the rules, and you'll be able to get
ahead in life.” And that's damaging because

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.650
it's not true. You know, we each come into
this world with a set of lived experiences

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.860
that have shaped us, and I think finding ways to meet people where they're at is really important.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.980
Cynthia: The whole tech space is fundamentally
very biased. And so you have to do things

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:47.460
differently in order to make sure that people
who are oppressed feel welcome in that environment,

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.720
and feel like they belong, and stay there.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.690
Lucas Nydam: Diversity, I don't think it's
like a strong-enough word. Just because they're

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.920
present doesn't mean they're heard. So it's
like you can have a room and have it be very

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.460
diverse but still have only one person, one
background talking,

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.740
one group of people supported and engaged.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.660
Louis: It is kind of naive to assume that
just by putting a lot of people from all over

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.840
the place in one job or in one office or in
one classroom that automatically, boom.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.100
Lorena: Which is why we see, you know, folks
who work in that area

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.260
moving towards the term of inclusion.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:29.280
Cynthia: Inclusivity requires the ability
to really examine your own biases and, you know,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.710
be willing to admit that you're biased.
And inclusivity is how you create an environment

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.720
where they all feel like they belong there.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.000
Lucas: When you bring diverse people to the
table you realize things that you didn't know

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.500
before, because they were invisible to you
because of your experience, because our experiences

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.880
are shaped by our race.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:55.470
Sean Riley: I believe that to be around folks
who, who see things differently than you is

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.030
good for you. And the more that can happen
in your life the more expansive your own sense

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.930
of identity will be, and the more you'll understand
yourself.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.620
Autumn: I don’t know, and I also think that
when you have exposure to the opposite race

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.080
or another race, it kind of makes your preconceived
notions a little different.
